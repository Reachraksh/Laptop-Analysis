# Laptop-Analysis
This project analyzes a dataset of laptops to understand the factors influencing their prices and build predictive models.
The analysis covers exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, visualizations, and machine learning models to predict laptop prices based on specifications.

üéØ Objectives

Perform EDA to discover trends, patterns, and relationships in the dataset.

Identify key features that affect laptop prices (e.g., CPU, GPU, RAM, ScreenResolution).

Build a regression model to predict laptop prices.

Use unsupervised learning to segment laptops into categories (Budget, Mid-range, Premium).

Provide insights & recommendations for laptop pricing strategies.
